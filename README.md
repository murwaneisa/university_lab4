# university_lab4

## Description

### This is a Node.js web application for user authentication and authorization. It uses the Express.js framework and the bcrypt and jsonwebtoken libraries for password hashing and generating and verifying JSON web tokens, respectively. The application also uses a simple database module for user data storage and retrieval. The application provides different routes for different user roles, such as student, teacher, and admin. It uses middleware functions to authenticate and authorize user requests based on their roles. The application also uses cookies to store and retrieve the JSON web token for user authentication. The code is well-structured and follows best practices for web application development. It is easy to understand and modify for specific use cases. A user can register for an account and log in with their credentials. The user is then redirected to a page based on their role, where they can access specific functionalities. Admins can view and manage user accounts, while students and teachers can access their respective dashboards. 
Overall, this is a useful codebase for developers looking to build a simple and secure user authentication and authorization system.
